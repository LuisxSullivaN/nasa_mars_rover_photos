# NASA Mars Rover Photos

This is an example project required for the SDJS Course at Enroute.

## Stack

* (Turborepo)[https://turborepo.org/]: Monorepo management and build tool. I already had used Nx in the past so I wanted to give turborepo a try.
* (Vite)[https://vitejs.dev/]: Basically a replacement of CRA. It's faster and meant for production-ready applications.
* (TailwindCSS)[https://tailwindcss.com/]: CSS utility-first library for styling. I didn't want to use a whole component library for a small project and tailwind is very small in size.
* (tRPC)[https://trpc.io/]: Library for writing typesafe APIs with typescript. It's a really cool tool and wanted to give it a try as it sits in between of REST and GraphQL.
* (React Query)[https://tanstack.com/query/v4/]: Library for asynchronous state management. Goodbye Redux.
* (pnpm)[https://pnpm.io/]: A better architected node package manager.
