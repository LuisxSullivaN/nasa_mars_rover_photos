# NASA Mars Rover Photos

This is an example project required for the SDJS Course at Enroute.

## Stack

* !(https://turborepo.org/)[Turborepo]: Monorepo management and build tool. I already had used Nx in the past so I wanted to give turborepo a try.
* !(https://vitejs.dev/)[Vite]: Basically a replacement of CRA. It's faster and meant for production-ready applications.
* !(https://tailwindcss.com/)[TailwindCSS]: CSS utility-first library for styling. I didn't want to use a whole component library for a small project and tailwind is very small in size.
* !(https://trpc.io/)[tRPC]: Library for writing typesafe APIs with typescript. It's a really cool tool and wanted to give it a try as it sits in between of REST and GraphQL.
* !(https://tanstack.com/query/v4/)[React Query]: Library for asynchronous state management. Goodbye Redux.
* !(https://pnpm.io/)[pnpm]: A better architected node package manager.
